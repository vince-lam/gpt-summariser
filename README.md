# YouTube Summariser

A simple app that allows the user to enter a YouTube URL and outputs a text summary of the audio content. I've found this tool to be a massive productivity time-saver when needing to quickly consume long-form content, such as lecturers and podcasts.

The aim of this project is to show how simple it is to build LLM demos using HuggingFace, gradio, and whisper - for the We Build Data community.
